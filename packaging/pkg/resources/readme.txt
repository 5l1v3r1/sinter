Before you continue, it is recommended to uninstall any existing copy of Sinter. An uninstall script (which is automatically started by this PKG installer when the installation starts) can be found at the following path: /Library/Application Support/Sinter/uninstall.sh

Once the setup has finished, don't forget to enable the "Full Disk Access" permission for /Application/Sinter.app from the "Privacy" panel under the Security & Privacy settings.
